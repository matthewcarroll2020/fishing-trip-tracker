# CCT Fishing Trip Tracker

Fishing isn’t just about the catch, it’s about the stories, memories, and details of each trip.  
The **Fishing Trip Tracker** is a React web app built to help anglers log and manage their fishing adventures.  
Users can sign in with their Google account, add trips with location and fish caught, and revisit their fishing history anytime.
